# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is the Github organization account of the **Prevention of Depression IPD project**. This organization hosts two types of repositories:

- `data`: A repository in which all IPD datasets are stored along with their metadata
- `analysis-` Multiple repositories in which the analysis code for each paper/subproject is stored. As a convention, these repositores all have the same prefix `analysis-`.
