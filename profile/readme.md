# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is the Github organization account of the **Prevention of Depression IPD project**. This organization hosts two types of repositories:

- `data`: A repository in which all IPD datasets are stored along with their metadata
- `analysis` Multiple repositories in which the analysis code for each paper/subproject is stored. As a convention, these repositores all have the same prefix `analysis-`.

_Note_: This organization account also contains two additional repositories: `.github` and `.github-private`. These repositories only exist for formal reasons and are used to show the readme you are seeing right now.
